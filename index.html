        <p>WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and
        the World Wide Web) is the first web browser[1] and web page editor.[2] It was
        discontinued in 1994. It was the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.
        The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993.[3][4] Some
        of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum
        and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.
        [5] To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web 
        to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware
        and software associated with the birth of the Web.[6]</p>
